Welcome to dsclim - A software package for statistical downscaling of
                    climate model scenario based on weather regimes.

Initial version by: Christian Page (Cerfacs) 2009, <christian.page@cerfacs.fr>

dsclim is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.
For documentation, please see the files in the doc subdirectory.
For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file.
For configuration example files, see the etc directory.

This software is a tool to perform statistical downscaling of numerical
model climate simulations (scenarios) developed at Cerfacs (Toulouse), France.
It is a methodology based on weather typing (weather regimes), initially
developed by Boe and Terray, 2008: A Weather-Type Approach to Analyzing
Winter Precipitation in France: Twentieth-Century Trends and the Role of
Anthropogenic Forcing, Journal of Climate, 21 (13), p. 3118.

Specific installation instructions
----------------------------------

The dsclim software package is meant to be easy to compile and install on
recent unix platforms. It is built using the standard GNU autoconf/automake
system.

The requirements are the following:
- A 32- or 64-bit recent unix system (tested on Linux 32- and 64-bit)
- The gzip, bzip2 and tar utilities
- A recent ANSI C compiler (tested with GNU GCC 4.x)
- A standard C math library (libm)
- The standard zlib data compression library (libz)
      http://www.zlib.net/
- The standard szip compression library (libsz)
      ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/
- The HDF5 library (libhdf5)
      ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4/
      and http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
- UCAR NetCDF 4.x library (libudunits)
      http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/
- UCAR UDUNITS 2.x library (libnetcdf)
      http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/udunits/
- The standard GNU Scientific Library (libgsl)
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
- The standard XML2 library (libxml2)
      http://xmlsoft.org/
Most of these should be already available on recent Linux systems, or directly
available through a packaging system like yum or urpmi.

Once the archive is uncompressed and untarred using
tar xvzf dsclim-x.x.x.tar.gz
one should run the configure utility inside the dsclim-x.x.x directory.
Here is one example when one want to install in a different directory than
/usr/local/bin and when needed libraries have been installed in
non-standard directories:
./configure --prefix=/home/globc/page/codes/local \\
--with-zlib=/opt2/glob/uti/local64 \\
--with-szlib=/opt2/glob/uti/local64 \\
--with-hdf5=/opt2/glob/uti/local64 \\
--with-netcdf=/opt2/glob/uti/local64 \\
--with-udunits=/opt2/glob/uti/local64

The next step is to compile by typing the command
make
followed by
make install
if everything went fine in the make process to install everything.
The executable is installed as $prefix/bin/dsclim, an example configuration
file is installed as $prefix/share/dsclim/configuration.xml.
$prefix stands as the directory specified by the --prefix argument when running
the configure utility (/usr/local/bin by default).

Datafiles for an example case are provided in a separate tar archive.
It is suggested to put the content of this archive in a specific directory to
be referenced in the configuration file.

Once installed, it is advised to copy the example configuration.xml file and
modify it for your needs. Then, if the $prefix directory is in your executable
$PATH environment variable, you can run dsclim just by typing
dsclim -conf configuration.xml
assuming that the configuration.xml file is in the current directory.
